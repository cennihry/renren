          Hi Reign!! I've been trying to hide these feelings for a very long time.
          I know it feels like a surprise but, i am inlove with you for a very long time now. I just want you to know that you're worth the risk, you deserve to be loved the way you wanted to be loved and you deserve what's best in this shady world.
          Im just scared that this confession might complicate our friendship. Im not forcing you to love me or like me back, so we can stay as friends if you want to, but i'll also be thankful if you let me be your suitor. I hope na 'di tayo maging awkward sa isa't isa after nito, dahil gusto kitang makasama panghabang buhay maging kaibigan man o ka-ibigan.
